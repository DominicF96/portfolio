___Communication — know the different challenges and how to address them___

When I started my career as a programmer, I thought that my main issue would be to make something work. It
wasn't. Communication was a huge problem in every company I worked for and I believe it has an enormous,
underestimated cost.

## Within the Software Team

The first goal of a software team should be to build their own internal documentation. Not only will it help
onboard new developers, but it will also be a goldmine when trying to explain to the rest of the company what
is going on and, most importantly, why certain counterintuitive decisions were made.

### Using the Right Tools For the Job

I've worked in 5 different companies so far. Large ones (100-500 employees) and smaller ones I've seen grow
(8-20 people). One common factor: Either they do not provide the right communication tools, or they use them
badly (if they use them at all). Here are some things to consider:

- I believe that only using a messaging app is not enough to run a successful software engineering department.
It could still work for a very small crew (up to 3 people).

- A serious project should consider some sort of internal wiki. Having a place to document business logic,
  architecture diagrams, database diagrams, objectives, meeting notes, etc., and having all of this easily
  accessible and searchable is key.
- Keep technical documentation in the code and README, everything else should be in the Wiki.

### Integrate Documentation in Your Process

Most developers won't write documentation unless they're specifically asked to. That makes it a lot harder for
anyone outside the development team (which probably meets daily to discuss the progress) to know what is going on.

Make documentation part of your process, which can be as simple as adding a column to your tasks board and a step
in the review process. Every task can come with a small report (that should be made into a quick-to-fill template)
discussing difficulties, design decisions, limitations, and so on. Most of the time, sure it probably won't be that
useful, but when looking for pain points in your development team or when you'll have to justify late deliveries,
they'll be a lifesaver.

### Reuse Content and Link Between Pages as Much as Possible

Again, developers don't want to maintain a 1000 pages knowledge base. A Wiki with a reusable content/linking feature
is golden. What that means is that if certain parts of the documentation need to be referenced, your Wiki should provide
you with the tools to do so. That will limit duplication, which in turn will make your maintenance easier and reduce
outdated information.

### Condense the Information Periodically

If you're successful at integrating high-quality documentation within your team, congratulations! But the fight doesn't
end there. A team of 5-10 people will quickly write a lot of documentation. Nobody has time to go through all of it.
Every week (or any period you consider adequate), you and your team should sit and regroup the information that's still
relevant and important, and send that new report to management for reviewing so they know what's going on.

### Finally… Take Variable Names Seriously

Some developers are very specific with their variable names, others are pretty freestyle. Documentation is also everywhere
in the code. Every line is an instruction on how the software operates, that's important. Reviewing variable names (as trivial
as it may sound) is an important part of the QA process.

## Across the Entire Company

The communication challenges are not only present in the software team, they're everywhere. Your managers should understand
the importance of giving and receiving information and making their decisions based on it.

### Communication is Bidirectional

Now that you have solved the documentation and communication issues within your software team, now's the time to value that
information. Make sure that the information flows both ways. Too often, the development team is at the bottom of the mountain
screaming while managers are up in the clouds measuring 2,000 different KPIs, hearing nothing.

Your managers should be very close to the software team, understand their needs and decisions, and let go of their power a
little for the greater good. A good manager will accept taking the long road to save money in the long run. A bad one will
ask you to rush everything as long as there's something somewhat working at a target date. Their KPIs will look good, but
the project will cost 10x what it's supposed to.

### Who's Responsible for What

Particularly in startups where you don't have an expert for everything, most people will likely take on more responsibility
than their title calls for — and if they do, it's a good sign in my opinion. The thing is, those avocations are not defined.
That can:

- Confuse people.
- Make management angry (aka "you're not doing your job").
- Cause people to work on the same thing.

### Everyone Needs a Common Vision

People have ideas. Everyone. So naturally, there will be as many visions as there are people within a company. The leadership
should communicate their goal clearly and precisely periodically to ensure everyone is and stays on the same page.

Anyways, that was my beautiful rant on communication. Let me know what you think!
